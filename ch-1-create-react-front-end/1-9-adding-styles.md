# Chapter 1 - Creating a React Front-End
## Lesson 9 - Adding Styles

The instructor provides CSS styles to apply to the app to improve the styling of the application. The styles can be found in the online repo or you can use your own styles if you choose.

[app.css](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site-5948186/blob/01_09_start/front-end/src/App.css)

[index.css](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site-5948186/blob/01_09_start/front-end/src/index.css)


In a React app the global CSS styles, styles that are applied to your entire application, are defined in "index.css".<br>
Styles applied only to the App component are defined in "App.css".

This concludes the front-end part of this course.
