# Chapter 1 - Creating a React Front-End
## Lesson 1 - Why React?

This course starts by building the front-end for our React app.
So why use React over hand coding your site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

React makes things simpler that hand coding a site without losing fine grain control. React uses the idea of components to build the user interface.

You might wonder why use React and write code when there are other no-code solutions that use a friendly drag-and-drop interface to create a website. The answer is, this course is meant for developers. If you are not a developer, the instructor suggests you look into one of the no-code website creation solutions.<br>
Examples of no-code online website creators:
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com)
- [Wix](https://www.wix.com)
- [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com)

React is a great solution for developers who want to build websites.
