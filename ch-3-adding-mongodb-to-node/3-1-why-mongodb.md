# Chapter 3 - Adding MongoDB to Node.js
## Lesson 1 - Why MongoDB

MongoDB is one database solution that can help persist data. This will make sure data is not lost when the server gets restarted. MongoDB is a good choice because it pairs well with JavaScript.

MongoDB is known as a "non-relational" database. MongoDB stores JSON-like data. This makes it easy for JavaScript to send a JSON-like object to MongoDB and return it when we need it.

In a traditional database the structure is defined ahead of time and must be followed when inserting and gathering data. You do not need to defined the structure ahead of time or have any knowledge of SQL when working with MongoDB.

MongoDB is also an open-source database, providing you the flexibility to use it as you see fit.

Overview of MongoDB:
* open source and easy to use
* a non-relational database with JSON-like data
* no need to learn SQL
