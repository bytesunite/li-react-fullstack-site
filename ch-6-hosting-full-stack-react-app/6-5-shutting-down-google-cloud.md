Go to your project dashboard in the Google Cloud Console
- in the top right click the three vertical dots and click "Billing Account Management"
- select the account you want to manage and click the "Go to account management page" button
- Under "actions" click on the vertical three dot button and click on "disable billing", then click on "disable billing". And that should shut down the project. This will stop your app from running.
