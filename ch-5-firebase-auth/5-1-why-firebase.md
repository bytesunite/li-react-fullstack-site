# Chapter 5 - Adding User Authentication with Firebase Auth
## Lesson 1 - Why Firebase Auth?

If we published the website as it is, anyone could upvote any article as many times as they want. People could add as many comments as they wanted. That is probably not what we want.

So to address this we will add a "login" and "create account" feature. The goal is to limit activity based on whether someone has an account, and is logged in.

Unfortunately adding user authentication from scratch is pretty difficult. If you are just getting started, it probably not be that secure unless you have a lot of experience. The alternative is a to use a ready built system like the *Firebase* which is a provider offering authentication solutions.

Before you start with Firebase you will have to create an account by going to the [Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/). Firebase has a free plan to get started, as well as a paid plan. You can learn more on their website.

The instructor asks you to create a Firebase account and will start showing how to use it in the next lesson.
