# Chapter 5 - Adding User Authentication with Firebase Auth
## Lesson 2 - Creating a Firebase Project

Once you have a Firebase account and login, you should have an interface with a button "Create a project".

1. Click the "Create a project" button<br>
   This will provide a walkthrough to setup a new project, like the project's name.
2. Provide "Full Stack React" as the project name, then click continue.<br>
   NOTE: A unique identifier is created, like "full-stack-react-934cb" which used as a project id for if/when you use Firebase hosting. It warns this id cannot be changed once it is created. You can modify it but this is not a public name.
3. Next, it asks you if you want to enable Google Analytics. Disable this.<br>
   Google Analytics is a very useful tool, but not needed for this project.
4. Click "Create project". It then thinks for a little while to setup your project.
5. Once it is done thinking it should show you that your Firebase project is ready. Then, click the continue button.

If everything was successful you should see your main Firebase account interface.
