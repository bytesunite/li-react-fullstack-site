# Chapter 2 - Creating a Node.js Back-End
## Lesson 1 - Why Node.js?

Now that we have a working client-side, it's time to look at building the back-end of the website. This course uses Node.js and Express to build the back-end.

[Express website](https://expressjs.org)

Using Node.js provides a way to build a back-end using JavaScript rather than using a different language such as Python, Java, PHP, etc. In the past, to be a full-stack developer, you had to be fluent in more than one programming language. But with Node.js, the entire website can be built using a single language, JavaScript. This is great news if you are a JavaScript developer or have a background in front-end development. Using JavaScript for building a full-stack site means you don't have to learn a new programming language or jump back in forth between different programming languages. (the small exception might be Typescript which is a superset of JavaScript).

There are many npm libraries you can use to write Node.js servers. The course uses Express, one of the most popular frameworks for building Node servers. 

The reasons for using Express include:
- It is a minimalist web framework, giving you flexibility
- It is easy to get started
- It is well documented
- There are a ton of 3rd party addons to extend its functionality
